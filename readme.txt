How to run:
-Run code in a IDE or compile into an .exe, file: Ui_import.py
-Simply by hitting run/executing, window should open
-Before getting started, make sure to import data
    ex
        SID,FirstName,LastName,Email,HW1,HW2,HW3,Quiz1,Quiz2,Quiz3,Quiz4,MidtermExam,FinalExam

-If import is successful, success message will be on screen
-Please check ONLY ONE bok at a time to get optimal results
-click through all buttons to see what prompts you get
-once prompts are filled out comletely hit "Search Criteria" at the top right of the screen 

-After running all attempts, hit export (bottom center) to get your new csv, entitled NEW_{csv_file_name}
    -File should be in code directory

LIMITATIONS:
-could not get checkmarks to be one at a time, could have used radio buttons although they have their own set of LIMITATIONS
-UI is not perfect on all systems, I had to switch to my desktop (windows) visualstudions due to python launcher not being able to render the screen
-code can only recognize csv files
-csv file must be formatted with equal headers
-not all routes have error catchers for simple explanation of issue

NICE TO HAVES:
-drop down menu when selecting assignment names when modifying student or searching by assignment
-terminal output displayed on window
-better looking UI in general
